ðŸ‘‰ To add this file:
1. Go to your GitHub repo, open the **vault** folder.  
2. Click **Add file â†’ Create new file**.  
3. Name it `README.md`.  
4. Paste the above content.  
5. Commit changes.  

Do you want me to also **edit your Vault webpage code** so it automatically displays the READMEâ€™s text at the top (like instructions for visitors), or should it stay developer-only?
