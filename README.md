# Rock Solid TV — Conspiracy Theme (with Starter Backgrounds)

This bundle includes:
- **Longer About** section (ban-proof keep-in-touch message)
- **Conspiracy theme** (Special Elite + Oswald, black/white/red)
- **Cracked earth** backgrounds (2 JPG textures generated locally)
- **Verse of the Day (KJV)** — light curated set via `verses.js`
- **Vault** using `vault/manifest.json` (no GitHub API required)

## How to use
1. Upload the contents of this folder to your repo `rocksolidtv/Rock-Solid-TV-web` (root).
2. Put your PDFs in `vault/` and list them in `vault/manifest.json`.
3. Replace or keep `images/cracked-earth-1.jpg` & `-2.jpg` as backgrounds (update CSS if you want to try the second texture).
4. GitHub Pages will rebuild — visit your domain to verify.

Stay Rock Solid.
